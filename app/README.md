# My Android App

This app is built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.</br>
It is a basic restaurant management application designed to create a connection between the manager and the waiter.</br>
The waiter takes orders from customers who come to dine at the restaurant and places those orders through the app. </br>
Once the manager accepts the order, the food is prepared and marked as ready to serve.</br>
